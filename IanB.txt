Hi, Lambda School!

My name is Ian Bryant. I am efficient, logical, and practical. 
A few things about me are that I love gaming, I love to read, and I adore animals of all shapes and sizes. 
I have four cats, and a dog who are my best friends in the world.

I'm looking forward to learning literally everything on our curriculum!

Thanks for reading,
See you all in class,
Ian


ALTERNATE REALITY MODE

This guy Nai loves SPORTSBALL, he goes hard in the paint! He NEVER skips leg day, he definitely doesn't take 
great care of a whole neighborhood's worth of stray cats!
